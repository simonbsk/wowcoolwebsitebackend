1.  make json in frontend remove "chartName" and just place the chart name as string
2.  do the same thing as above but for "chartData"
3.  make a lot of IDs disappear using @JsonIgnore
4.  make "" appear from the variables so its not "values": [] but just values: []
5.  make different classes for different graphs (use each required component>build scatter/bar/... graph out of it)
    maybe frontend better idk?
